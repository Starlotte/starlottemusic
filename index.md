## Hey guys!

So long story short, the previous website I had set up ended up getting deleted. I'm currently in the process of recreating it in GitHub, which should be more stable. 

This is a bit messy, but should only be temporary. The site'll be up and running again in no time.

## Contact Me

Currently, if you're interested in commissioning me, email me at starlottemusic@gmail.com.
I'll send you prices then.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
